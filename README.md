# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? How do I approach designing software?
By taking an Agile-based approach to software development, I first analyze the project requirements and write out User Stories and acceptance criteria to ensure I meet all of the client’s needs during development. From the first line of code, I am constantly thinking of how to best meet the client’s needs with functional, efficient, secure code. To ensure this functionality, I regularly test programs as I write them, it is best to find bugs and defects ASAP so I make certain to stay vigilant. Additionally, I utilize Regression Testing, which allows me to check that all written code continues functioning as intended as new code is written by myself or fellow developers.
